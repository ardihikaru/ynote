Yung-Yu Chen's Notes
====================

I develop computer code for solving partial differential equations of the
first-order, quasi-linear form by using :doc:`the space-time Conservation
Element and Solution Element (CESE) method <cese/index>`, for modeling
compressible flows, acoustic waves, stress waves, and electromagnetic waves.  I
am interested in high-performance software systems, and use :doc:`Python
<python/index>` to command the wild C and C++.
