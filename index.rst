I develop computer code for solving conservation laws by using :doc:`the
space-time Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE) method
<cese/index>`.  I am interested in high-performance software systems, and use
:doc:`Python <python/index>` to command the wild C and C++.  Contact
information is shown in :doc:`contact`.
