Organizing References Using Zotero
==================================

Zotero_ is an online and/or offline reference organizing/archiving tool.
Zotero is a Firefox/Mozilla addon.  Zotero is free of charge and `open-sourced
<http://www.opensource.org/>`_.

Organizing references is time-consuming.  However, without an organized
referential library, it consumes even more time to do literature review or pin
down the references for a research work.  Zotero provides an effective
approach to the organization.

Four things make Zotero special:

* Zotero is cross-platform.  As long as Firefox works, Zotero works.
* Zotero can operate without internet connection.  On the other hand, some 
  online reference organization software, e.g., RefWork®, *require* internet
  connection, since they are implemented as web applications and executed
  remotely.
* Zotero maintains a centralized server for a user to *synchronize* the 
  referential library across various computers the user uses.  Traditional 
  bibliography software such as EndNote® has difficulty to synchronize
  libraries in multiple computers.
* Zotero allows to create groups on their server, and the groups automatically
  appear in the UI of Firefox on users' computer.  Attached files can also be
  shared among group members through the online storage provided on Zotero
  server.  Extra storage can be purchased.

To use Zotero with the nice synchronization feature needs only three steps:

1. Go to http://www.zotero.org/ using your Firefox browser, and click Download
   button to install.
2. Still in the `Zotero homepage <http://www.zotero.org/>`_.  Register an 
   account.
3. In the Zotero UI in Firefox, press the setting button (Gear icon) and select
   Preference.  Press the Sync button and provide the user name and password 
   that you just obtained in the registration of Zotero account.
