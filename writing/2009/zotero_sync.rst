Zotero features synchronization
===============================

`A research tool with synchronization can then be really useful tool
<http://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-15-beta-released-join-us-in-the-clouds/>`_.
After 8 months of alpha test, in this month zotero released the first beta (1.5
beta 1) that allows users to synchronize database to zotero.org .  Although
zotero.org does not offer space for attached files, the plug-in allows user to
synchronize attached files to any webdav-available spaces, such as mydisk_.

The synchronization makes zotero really handy.  User is warned that it is 
currently in beta phase, and there is still risk to lose data in this release.
Database should be backed up regularly.
