Software
========

To assist my research (and other) work, I have tried various software.  After
all, I found the following software tools/systems are optimal for me:

* Operating system: Debian_ or Ubuntu_.  Both OSes are very powerful and
  easy-to-use, but I perfer Debian because of its stability and package
  quality.  The current stable distribution of Debian (lenny) contains 28,000+
  software packages.  While using Debian for workstation/desktop, it is a
  common practice to use the *testing* distribution rather than the stable one.
  The releasing period of Debian stable is fairly long, so that usually you may
  not find the most current version of software.  Since the packages in Debian
  stable are well maintained and almost don't change for a very long period of
  time, Debian stable is very suitable for servers.
* Reference organization: Zotero_.  Zotero is a great tool to provide
  online/offline reference organization.  Zotero is cross-platform since it is
  a Firefox add-on.  Attached files can also be synchronized in Zotero.  Group
  collaboration are easy through Zotero's server.  See `this page
  <2010/zotero_intro.html>`__ for more information.
* Editor: Vim_ / `gVim <http://www.vim.org/>`_.  Vim is a powerful and 
  general-purpose editor for coding, text-editing, and everything.  Vim can be
  the only tool for one to edit.
* Tex/Latex: Texlive_ (for Windows, `MikTex <http://www.miktex.org/>`_).
  Tex/Latex provides the highest quality for typesetting, and anything can be
  typesetted by Tex/Latex.  Tex/Latex is the only system that I've ever known
  to be able to productively typeset a large amount of mathematical formulae,
  i.e., hundreds or thousands of equations in a document.  Combined with Zotero
  and bibtex, Tex/Latex is the most efficient way that I know to edit academic
  papers.
* Version control: Mercurial_ (for Windows GUI, `TortoiseHg
  <http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org>`_).  Version control is very important for
  productive coding and writing.  It is also very important for collaboration
  in writing.
* Build system: SCons_.  SCons is a very flexible build system.  It supports
  sophisticated customization, and can be easily customized for automating
  data-processing for Tex/Latex, such as image editing and converting,
  bibliography processing.
* Generic programming: Python_.  See `this page <../python.html>`__ for more
  explanation.
